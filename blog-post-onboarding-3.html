        <h2>Month Three (Post Bootcamp) November</h2>
        <h5>Plan</h5>
        <p>This month I have been continuing with job applications, with a steady stream of rejection emails that usually follow. I have been learning the basics of C# and plan to keep digging into it further. I completed a virtual synthesizer project using Next.JS which I am quite proud of, although I have been running into an issue with the deployment of it so as of now it's been for my eyes only, I hope to fix the issue and post it up on Linkedin. I've also completed a few mini project on a seperate repo, again using Next.Js. Other than those two project repos I have been keeping steady with using code wars and going over all my notes I have collected over the past few months to make sure I don't forget anything.</p>
        <h5>Thoughts?</h5>
        <p>I am excited for this career switch but have definitely felt the switch in environment difficult at times. I oddly realize now in hindsight that I enjoyed the stress and deadlines that came along with projects and feeling a certain level of expectation for quality of work coming from the tutors. I have managed to stay self disciplined so far and have overall kept to my daily plans for studying and working although at the time of writing this I'm in bed with the flu so the last few days have not been my most productive. </p>
