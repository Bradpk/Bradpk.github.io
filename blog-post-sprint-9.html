        <h3>What has been your experience overall thus far? What would you want to post as a “retrospective”?
        </h3>

        <p>Overall my experience with Django and the Django Rest Framework, has been up and down. Getting the project
            set up seemed to be half the battle and was very frustrating. Although once I figured out how to get
            everything installed and running
            the project seemed fairly easy. Creating our own database in hindset was not the mountain it initally
            seemed, and the thunder client extension we used made running CRUD operations on our database infomation a
            piece of cake. </p>
