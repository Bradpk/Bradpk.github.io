        <h2>(Sprint 4)</h2>

        <h3>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h3>

        <p>As of right now, I think they are hard to use. I do see how they will stream line the coding process in the
            long run but since I am still in the stages of learning how to work with react I found it more difficult
            than working with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h3>

        <p>I'm not aware of most of the frameworks out there. Right now I would like to get comfortable in using the
            library we were introduced to this week which was React</p>

        <h3>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.</h3>

        <p>I am intending to do a final project that incorporates a library that allows me to produce audio that I can
            use to contruct aural training excercises for musicians. So I would like to explore which would be the best
            library for my project and how to use it to it's fullest extent.</p>
