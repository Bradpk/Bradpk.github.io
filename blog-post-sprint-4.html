        <h2>(WEEK 6)</h2>

        <h3>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h3>

        <p>Currently, I find them challenging to use. I do recognize that they have the potential to streamline the
            coding process in the long run. However, since I'm still in the early stages of learning how to work with
            React, I find it more difficult compared to working with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h3>

        <p>I'm not familiar with most of the frameworks out there. Right now, I would like to become more comfortable
            using React, the library we were introduced to this week. I have a good grasp of how functional components
            are used and how to utilize the useState hook, but there's a rabbit hole in React that I intend to dive
            into.
        </p>

        <h3>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.</h3>

        <p>I intend to work on a final project that involves incorporating a library capable of producing audio, which I
            can utilize to create aural training exercises for musicians. So I would like to explore and
            determine the most suitable library for my project, as well as learn how to leverage its full potential.</p>
