        <h3>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h3>

        <p>So far I have learnt and am familiar with some basic CLI commands such as cd, ls, mkdir, pwd and a few others. Yes CLI's still seem a little scary at this point because I know my current knowledge is merely scratching the surface.  </p>

        <h3>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
        </h3>

        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h3>

        <p></p>
