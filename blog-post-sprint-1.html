        <h2>(WEEK 3)</h2>

        <h3>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>

        <p>Definitely figuring out how to approach problem-solving, I felt confident going into this week. My
            understanding
            of JavaScript syntax and what I'm looking at on the screen is coming together. Although I was cut down to
            size
            and felt a little dissapointed in myself after this weeks project. I realized that merely knowing and
            understanding syntax doesn't get you very far. I need to become much more methodical and calculated in how I
            approach future projects.
        <p>

        <h3>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures),
            Bootstrap, or
            Atomic Design?</h3>

        <p>I would like to gain a deeper knowledge of what Bootstrap is capable of. Currently, I have a preference for
            using
            standard CSS, but I'm curious to see whether that will change once I'm more familiar with Bootstrap.
        <p>

        <h3>What is your “Why”?</h3>

        <p>I'm a creative at my core. I enjoy the process of learning new skills and then using those skills to craft
            something that I or other people may find useful, interesting, or entertaining. I'd be lying if I said I'm
            driven by grandiose ideas of legacy or believing I'm going to have some big impact on the world. I figure I
            only
            get one life, and I may as well fill it with things I find interesting. Programming has fallen into that
            category.
        <p>
