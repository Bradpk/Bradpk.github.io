        <h2>(WEEK 4)</h2>

        <h3>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h3>

        <p>This week, the most valuable lesson I learned was the significance of strategizing before diving into a
            project.
            By approaching tasks in a calculated manner, you ultimately save time in the long run, even if it means
            delaying
            the actual coding process. This involves thoroughly analyzing the project, planning the logic, and outlining
            the
            implementation steps.</p>

        <h3>What does it mean to develop good code?</h3>

        <p>I would say that high-quality code should prioritize readability. It should steer clear of unnecessary
            repetitions and be easily modifiable and reusable.</p>

        <h3>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h3>

        <p>I believe a good developer possesses a solid understanding of the problem at hand and can break it down into
            clear and actionable steps for resolution. Equally important is the ability to collaborate effectively with
            other developers, creating an environment where problem-solving becomes a streamlined and enjoyable journey
            for
            the entire team.</p>

        <h3>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h3>

        <p>As someone new to the world of programming, I am not yet familiar with the common frustrations experienced by
            programmers. However, I can easily imagine that debugging would fall into this category. The time-consuming
            nature of debugging leads me to believe that it's a safe assumption many programmers wouldn't have this type
            of
            work on the top of their list of favorite tasks.</p>
