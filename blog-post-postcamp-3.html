        <h2>Month Three (Post Bootcamp) November</h2>
        <h5>Plan</h5>
        <p>This month I have been continuing with job applications, with a steady stream of rejection emails that usually follow. I have been learning the basics of C# and plan to keep digging into it further. I completed a virtual synthesizer project using Next.JS which I am quite proud of, although I have been running into an issue with the deployment of it so as of now it's been for my eyes only, I hope to fix the issue and post it up on Linkedin. I've also completed a few mini project on a seperate repo, again using Next.Js. Other than those two project repos I have been keeping steady with using code wars and going over all my notes I have collected over the past few months to make sure I don't forget anything.</p>
        <h5>Thoughts?</h5>
        <p> I'm heading back to New Zealand for a couple months to see family so I'm feeling like my job hunt is going to jeopardized by the fact I am not in the US. I will continue to apply for jobs and try make connections while I am in NZ but realize I would not be able to accept any jobs that require me to start asap if it came to that. The length of this job hunt is brutal and am really hoping I can get into the industry but it's certainly difficult to fight the pessimisim when you are applying for jobs and notice you are often one of over a thousand applicants. I'm going to keep pushing on and learning regardless of how long it takes to land that first job.  </p>
