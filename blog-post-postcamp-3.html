        <h2>Month Three (Post Bootcamp) November</h2>
        <h5>Plan</h5>
        <p>This month, I've been diligently working on job applications, navigating a sea of rejection emails that seem to be part and parcel of the process. Alongside that, I've been immersing myself in the fundamentals of C#, with plans to delve even deeper. A notable achievement is the completion of a virtual synthesizer project using Next.JS, a project I'm genuinely proud of. Unfortunately, a deployment hiccup has kept it under wraps for now, but I'm determined to troubleshoot and share it on LinkedIn soon. Additionally, I've wrapped up a couple of mini-projects in a separate repository, again leveraging the power of Next.JS. Beyond these coding endeavors, I've stayed sharp with CodeWars challenges and revisited my extensive notes to ensure nothing slips from my memory.</p>
        <h5>Thoughts?</h5>
        <p> I'm headed back to New Zealand for a couple of months to spend time with family. I'm a bit concerned that being outside the US might complicate my job hunt, especially if potential employers are looking for someone to start ASAP. Despite this, I'll persist in applying for jobs and making connections while in NZ. Realistically, I won't be able to accept immediate job offers, but I'm committed to continuing the search. The duration of this job hunt has been tough, and the sheer number of applicants for each position can be disheartening. However, I'm determined to break into the industry and will keep pushing forward, learning and growing, regardless of how long it takes to land that first job. </p>
