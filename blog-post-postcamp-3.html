        <h2>Month Three (Post Bootcamp) November</h2>
        <h5>Plan</h5>
        <p>This month, I've been diligently working on job applications, navigating a sea of rejection emails that seem to be part and parcel of the process. Alongside that, I've been immersing myself in the fundamentals of C#, with plans to delve even deeper. A notable achievement is the completion of a virtual synthesizer project using Next.JS, a project I'm genuinely proud of. Unfortunately, a deployment hiccup has kept it under wraps for now, but I'm determined to troubleshoot and share it on LinkedIn soon. Additionally, I've wrapped up a couple of mini-projects in a separate repository, again leveraging the power of Next.JS. Beyond these coding endeavors, I've stayed sharp with CodeWars challenges and revisited my extensive notes to ensure nothing slips from my memory.</p>
        <h5>Thoughts?</h5>
        <p> I'm heading back to New Zealand for a couple months to see family so I'm feeling like my job hunt is going to jeopardized by the fact I am not in the US. I will continue to apply for jobs and try make connections while I am in NZ but realize I would not be able to accept any jobs that require me to start asap if it came to that. The length of this job hunt is brutal and am really hoping I can get into the industry but it's certainly difficult to fight the pessimisim when you are applying for jobs and notice you are often one of over a thousand applicants. I'm going to keep pushing on and learning regardless of how long it takes to land that first job.  </p>
