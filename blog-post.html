        <h1>Awesome Inc Blog Post</h1>

        <h2>(WEEK 1)</h2>

        <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

        <p> Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how it would be
            structured, so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. I think the boot camp strikes a
            good balance between self problem solving which prepares us of what an actual job environment would be like,
            yet
            having the tutors there to help us out if we hit a blocker. What struck me out of the gate, is how quickly I
            am
            going to have to adapt to being in a learning environment again. The last time I was in school was about 8
            years
            ago so it's been a fair minute. It's a little intimidating but I am up for a challenge and I'm curious to
            see
            how well I will be able to retain all this new information. Big Ups to the tutors and the rest of the class,
            everybody has been very supportive and helpful. </p>

        <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

        <p>The thing I am looking forward to the most is getting to the point where I have a big picture understanding
            of
            the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a jigsaw puzzle, not yet aware of the picture that
            will
            be created. I want to be able to create an app or interactive website from go to whoa! If I had to be more
            specific though, I'm looking forward to both <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> as they
            seem to be the nuts and bolts of coding. </p>

        <h3>What is something about you that can be learned by reading this blog?</h3>

        <p> I am originally from New Zealand and moved here impulsively in 2019 after winning a green card in a lottery.
            My
            primary hobbies are playing guitar, rock climbing and just recently coding. One thing people may not know
            about
            me is that I use to work as a deckhand in the superyacht industry in Europe. </p>

        <h2>(WEEK 2)</h2>

        <h3>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content
            and
            providing user experience?</h3>

        <p>The anology I have latched onto is that HTML is the builder, CSS is the artist and JavaScript is the wizard.
            They
            each play an important role in the creation of an app or webpage.
        <p>

        <h3>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h3>

        <p>It didn't strike me immediately why pseudocoding is so important, but once I understood that programming is
            essentially just logic based problem solving I realised it's importance. The particular language you use is
            really just the tool you are using to solve the problem. Merely knowing how to use the tools and resources
            required to build a house doesn't mean you are going to be able to build a house. To be able to create what
            you
            are wanting to create requires the step by step knowledge and wisdom of how to do so. That is what good
            pseudocode is!
        <p>

        <h3>What was helpful during Onboarding that made working remotely easier?</h3>

        <p>It's difficult to pin point a single aspect. Before onboarding I essentially had zero knowledge of anything
            within the programming realm. The mindset of being able to dig myself out of a hole instead of having to
            rely on
            other people I think is one trait that will be invaluable while working remotely.
        <p>

        <h3>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h3>

        <p>In the first week I espicially suffered from a lack of organization. I was crunched for time and felt like
            the
            work load was being piled up faster than I was able to work through it.
        <p>

        <h3>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h3>

        <p>I overcame the challenges by using a brute force attitude to time commitment. I was able to get through all
            the
            material by extending out the ammount of time I was studying. In the future I would like to hone in my
            efficiency when tackling new problems or material as to produce the greatest output I can muster in a timely
            manner that doesn't leave me exhausted. Work smarter not harder.
        <p>

        <h2>(WEEK 3)</h2>

        <h3>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>

        <p>Definitely figuring out how to approach problem-solving, I felt confident going into this week. My
            understanding
            of JavaScript syntax and what I'm looking at on the screen is coming together. Although I was cut down to
            size
            and felt a little dissapointed in myself after this weeks project. I realized that merely knowing and
            understanding syntax doesn't get you very far. I need to become much more methodical and calculated in how I
            approach future projects.
        <p>

        <h3>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures),
            Bootstrap, or
            Atomic Design?</h3>

        <p>I would like to gain a deeper knowledge of what Bootstrap is capable of. Currently, I have a preference for
            using
            standard CSS, but I'm curious to see whether that will change once I'm more familiar with Bootstrap.
        <p>

        <h3>What is your “Why”?</h3>

        <p>I'm a creative at my core. I enjoy the process of learning new skills and then using those skills to craft
            something that I or other people may find useful, interesting, or entertaining. I'd be lying if I said I'm
            driven by grandiose ideas of legacy or believing I'm going to have some big impact on the world. I figure I
            only
            get one life, and I may as well fill it with things I find interesting. Programming has fallen into that
            category.
        <p>

        <h2>(WEEK 4)</h2>

        <h3>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h3>

        <p>This week, the most valuable lesson I learned was the significance of strategizing before diving into a
            project.
            By approaching tasks in a calculated manner, you ultimately save time in the long run, even if it means
            delaying
            the actual coding process. This involves thoroughly analyzing the project, planning the logic, and outlining
            the
            implementation steps.</p>

        <h3>What does it mean to develop good code?</h3>

        <p>I would say that high-quality code should prioritize readability. It should steer clear of unnecessary
            repetitions and be easily modifiable and reusable.</p>

        <h3>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h3>

        <p>I believe a good developer possesses a solid understanding of the problem at hand and can break it down into
            clear and actionable steps for resolution. Equally important is the ability to collaborate effectively with
            other developers, creating an environment where problem-solving becomes a streamlined and enjoyable journey
            for
            the entire team.</p>

        <h3>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h3>

        <p>As someone new to the world of programming, I am not yet familiar with the common frustrations experienced by
            programmers. However, I can easily imagine that debugging would fall into this category. The time-consuming
            nature of debugging leads me to believe that it's a safe assumption many programmers wouldn't have this type
            of
            work on the top of their list of favorite tasks.</p>

        <h2>(WEEK 5)</h2>

        <h3>What is pseudocode and how does it help with programming?</h3>

        <p>Pseudocode is a term used to describe the process that programmers follow to outline the steps needed to
            solve
            problems in a project. It is written in a non-coding language, allowing programmers to understand what the
            code
            should do without focusing on syntax. This skill is highly valuable in becoming a proficient programmer as
            it
            goes beyond specific programming languages and can be utilized by programmers working with different
            languages.
            Pseudocode enables collaboration among programmers by providing a clear understanding of the logical flow
            and
            actions required to achieve desired outcomes.</p>

        <h2>(WEEK 6)</h2>

        <h3>Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h3>

        <p>Currently, I find them challenging to use. I do recognize that they have the potential to streamline the
            coding process in the long run. However, since I'm still in the early stages of learning how to work with
            React, I find it more difficult compared to working with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h3>

        <p>I'm not familiar with most of the frameworks out there. Right now, I would like to become more comfortable
            using React, the library we were introduced to this week. I have a good grasp of how functional components
            are used and how to utilize the useState hook, but there's a rabbit hole in React that I intend to dive
            into.
        </p>

        <h3>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.</h3>

        <p>I intend to work on a final project that involves incorporating a library capable of producing audio, which I
            can utilize to create aural training exercises for musicians. So I would like to explore and
            determine the most suitable library for my project, as well as learn how to leverage its full potential.</p>

        <h2>(WEEK 7)</h2>

        <h3>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h3>

        <p>So far I have learnt and am familiar with some basic CLI commands such as cd, ls, mkdir, pwd and a few
            others. Yes CLI's still seem a little scary at this point because I know my current knowledge is merely
            scratching the surface. </p>

        <h3>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
        </h3>

        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h3>

        <h2>(WEEK 8)</h2>

        <h3>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do
            you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</h3>

        <p>I think my biggest hurdles in the bootcamp have been more or less the same since day one. The answer being
            retention and how quicky I'm able to adapt to new concepts and information. It's incredibly fast paced, to a
            point where I'm questioning whether I'm absorbing all the information needed before we move on to the next
            topic </p>

        <h3>Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same
            ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your
            limitations?
        </h3>

        <p>My idea since day one of the bootcamp, which hasn't changed, has been to create an app that aids in aural ear
            training for musicians. Thats the idea I'm gunning for but if for whatever reason that idea doesn't work out
            then I'm also considering an app targeted towards climbers, something similiar to mountain project or an app
            that keeps track of famous musicians and their current gear stack.
        </p>

        <h3>What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in
            JavaScript?</h3>

        <p>The syntax is a lot for refined and simplified compared to JavaScript which I will end up liking, although I
            found myself typing JavaScript into Python out of muscle memory ao I'm going to have to override my brain to
            get use to both languages.</p>

        <h2>(WEEK 9)</h2>

        <h3>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?
        </h3>

        <p>Both programming languages exhibit a strikingly similar structure, encompassing a common set of data types,
            conditional statements, and loops. However, a notable distinction lies in their syntax, where one language
            employs indentation instead of curly braces for code block delineation.</p>

        <h3>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you
            have benefited?

        </h3>

        <p>While acknowledging the Python language's intuitive syntax, I believe that learning JavaScript, with its
            meticulous nature, fosters a greater emphasis on code accuracy and precision. This emphasis on accuracy
            cultivates a more thorough approach to coding, which can be highly beneficial in developing robust and
            error-free software solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might
            look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see
            yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?
        </h3>

        <p>An app that I use a lot is the "guitartuna" app which provides a guitar tuner and metronome which I use for
            teaching. I could imagine the data structure would consist of <br> Tuning ID: A unique identifier for each
            tuning.
            Name: The name of the tuning, "Standard," "Drop D," "Half Step Down," etc.
            Notes: The specific notes corresponding to each string in the tuning.
            Chord ID: A unique identifier for each chord.
            Name: The name of the chord, like "C Major," "G7," "Dm," etc.
            Notes: The individual notes that make up the chord.
            Audio: Audio representation of the chord for playback.
            <br>
            I'm planning on building a similiar app for my cap stone project.
        </p>

        <h2>(WEEK 10)</h2>

        <h3>What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?
        </h3>

        <p>Theres no specific aspect I feel like I am struggling with but rather just suffering from a lack of a deeper
            understanding of the tech stack I am using. I understand them well enough to achieve the projects we have
            been given thus far but am aware that there are many rabbit holes espicially with react and django that I
            have not gone down.</p>

        <h3>What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and learn?
        </h3>

        <p> It would be really cool if we had an opportunity to speak with some of the big wigs of the tech industry.
            Google, Meta etc..
        </p>

        <h3>After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point
            for you? Were you able to reconnect your React Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so, what was that
            like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump?
        </h3>

        <p>Yeah I did manage to reconnect my previous React Restaurant project to my backend bistro project and it was a
            lot easier than I expected. It was as simple as exchanging the link in the API call with the new http link
            from my API created in the backend bistro project. Really the only difficultly I faced with connecting the
            two was that I forgot I had to activate the CORS extension on google chrome and also forgot I had to type in
            the commnad "npm start" to view the react project in the browser. Which are two very minor problems.
        </p>
