        <h2>(WEEK 8)</h2>

        <h3>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do
            you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</h3>

        <p>I think my biggest hurdles in the bootcamp have been more or less the same since day one. The answer being
            retention and how quicky I'm able to adapt to new concepts and information. It's incredibly fast paced, to a
            point where I'm questioning whether I'm absorbing all the information needed before we move on to the next
            topic </p>

        <h3>Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same
            ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your
            limitations?
        </h3>

        <p>My idea since day one of the bootcamp, which hasn't changed, has been to create an app that aids in aural ear
            training for musicians. Thats the idea I'm gunning for but if for whatever reason that idea doesn't work out
            then I'm also considering an app targeted towards climbers, something similiar to mountain project or an app
            that keeps track of famous musicians and their current gear stack.
        </p>

        <h3>What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in
            JavaScript?</h3>

        <p>The syntax is a lot for refined and simplified compared to JavaScript which I will end up liking, although I
            found myself typing JavaScript into Python out of muscle memory ao I'm going to have to override my brain to
            get use to both languages.</p>
