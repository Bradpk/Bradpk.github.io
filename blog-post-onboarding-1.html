        <h2>(WEEK 1)</h2>

        <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

        <p> Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how it would be
            structured, so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. I think the boot camp strikes a
            good balance between self problem solving which prepares us of what an actual job environment would be like,
            yet
            having the tutors there to help us out if we hit a blocker. What struck me out of the gate, is how quickly I
            am
            going to have to adapt to being in a learning environment again. The last time I was in school was about 8
            years
            ago so it's been a fair minute. It's a little intimidating but I am up for a challenge and I'm curious to
            see
            how well I will be able to retain all this new information. Big Ups to the tutors and the rest of the class,
            everybody has been very supportive and helpful. </p>

        <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

        <p>The thing I am looking forward to the most is getting to the point where I have a big picture understanding
            of
            the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a jigsaw puzzle, not yet aware of the picture that
            will
            be created. I want to be able to create an app or interactive website from go to whoa! If I had to be more
            specific though, I'm looking forward to both <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> as they
            seem to be the nuts and bolts of coding. </p>

        <h3>What is something about you that can be learned by reading this blog?</h3>

        <p> I am originally from New Zealand and moved here impulsively in 2019 after winning a green card in a lottery.
            My
            primary hobbies are playing guitar, rock climbing and just recently coding. One thing people may not know
            about
            me is that I use to work as a deckhand in the superyacht industry in Europe. </p>
