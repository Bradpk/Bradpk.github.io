## **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**   üíª

<font size='2'> Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how it would be structured, so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. I think the boot camp strikes a good balance between self problem solving whcih prepares us of what an actual job environment would be like, yet having the tutors there to help us out if we hit a blocker. What struck me out of the gate, is how quickly I am going to have to adapt to being in a learning environment again. The last time I was in school was about 8 years ago so it's been a fair minute. It's a little intimidating but I am up for a challenge and I'm curious to see how well I will be able to retain all this new information. Big Ups to the tutors and the rest of the class, everybody has been very supportive and helpful. </font>

## **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**   üñ±Ô∏è

<font size='2'> The thing I am looking forward to the most is getting to the point where I have a big picture understanding of the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a jigsaw puzzle, not yet aware of the picture that will be created. I want to be able to create an app or interactive website from go to whoa! If I had to be more specific though, I'm looking forward to both <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> as they seem to be the nuts and bolts of coding. </font>

## **What is something about you that can be learned by reading this blog?**   üñ•Ô∏è

<font size='2'> I am originally from New Zealand and moved here impulsively in 2019 after winning a green card in a lottery. My primary hobbies are playing guitar, rock climbing and just recently coding. One thing people may not know about me is that I use to work as a deckhand in the superyacht industry in Europe. </font>
