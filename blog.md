## **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**   üíª

<font size='3'> Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how it would be structured so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. What struck me out of the gate, is how quickly I am going to have to adapt to being in a learning environment again. The last time I was in school was about 8 years ago so it's been a fair minute. It's a little intimidating but I am up for a challenge and I'm curious to see how well I will be able to retain all this new information. Big Ups to the tutors, they've been great! </font>

## **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**   üñ±Ô∏è

<font size='3'> The thing I am looking forward the most is getting to the point where I have a big picture understanding of the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a jigsaw puzzle, not yet aware of the picture that will be created. I want to be able to create an app or interactive website from go to whoa! </font>
