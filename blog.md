## **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?** ##

### Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how it would be structured so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. What struck me out of the gate however is how quickly I am going to have to pick up all these new skills. It's a little intimidated and I'm curious to see how well I will be able to retain all this new information. 

## **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?** ##

### The main thing I am looking forward to is getting to the point where I have a big picture understanding of the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a large jigsaw puzzle yet I'm not yet aware of the picture that will be made at the end. ###

## **What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?** ##

### Considering we all pretty much have our lives open sourced through social media by now not much remains a mystery. I am originally from New Zealand and moved here in 2019. My main hobbies are playing guitar, rock climbing and just recently coding. One thing that I don't think anybody knows about me which I will reveal on this blog post is that I try to do different accents when ordering food at the drive thru just to see if anybody will notice.
