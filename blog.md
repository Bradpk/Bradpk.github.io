## **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**   üíª

<font size='2'> Going into this, I didn't have any preconceptions about what the bootcamp would be like or how it would be structured, so I can't say either way that it was or wasn't what I expected. I think the boot camp strikes a good balance between self problem solving which prepares us of what an actual job environment would be like, yet having the tutors there to help us out if we hit a blocker. What struck me out of the gate, is how quickly I am going to have to adapt to being in a learning environment again. The last time I was in school was about 8 years ago so it's been a fair minute. It's a little intimidating but I am up for a challenge and I'm curious to see how well I will be able to retain all this new information. Big Ups to the tutors and the rest of the class, everybody has been very supportive and helpful. </font>

## **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**   üñ±Ô∏è

<font size='2'> The thing I am looking forward to the most is getting to the point where I have a big picture understanding of the entire process. Right now it feels like I am doing a jigsaw puzzle, not yet aware of the picture that will be created. I want to be able to create an app or interactive website from go to whoa! If I had to be more specific though, I'm looking forward to both <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> as they seem to be the nuts and bolts of coding. </font>

## **What is something about you that can be learned by reading this blog?**   üñ•Ô∏è

<font size='2'> I am originally from New Zealand and moved here impulsively in 2019 after winning a green card in a lottery. My primary hobbies are playing guitar, rock climbing and just recently coding. One thing people may not know about me is that I use to work as a deckhand in the superyacht industry in Europe. </font>

## **(Week 2)** ##

## **What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?** ##
<font size='2'>The anology I have latched onto is that HTML is the builder, CSS is the artist and JavaScript is the wizard. They each play an important role in the creation of an app or webpage. </font>

## **What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?** ##
<font size='2'>It didn't strike me immediately why pseudocoding is so important, but once I understood that programming is essentially just logic based problem solving I realised it's importance. The particular language you use is really just the tool you are using to solve the problem. Merely knowing how to use the tools and resources required to build a house doesn't mean you are going to be able to build a house. To be able to create what you are wanting to create requires the step by step knowledge and wisdom of how to do so. That is what good pseudocode is! </font>
  
## **What was helpful during Onboarding that made working remotely easier?** ##
<font size='2'>It's difficult to pin point a single aspect. Before onboarding I essentially had zero knowledge of anything within the programming realm. The mindset of being able to dig myself out of a hole instead of having to rely on other people I think is one trait that will be invaluable while working remotely. </font>
  
## **What hindered your progress during Onboarding?** ##
<font size='2'>In the first week I espicially suffered from a lack of organization. I was crunched for time and felt like the work load was being piled up faster than I was able to work through it.</font>
  
## **How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?** ##
<font size='2'>I overcame the challenges by using a brute force attitude to time commitment. I was able to get through all the material by extending out the ammount of time I was studying. In the future I would like to hone in my efficiency when tackling new problems or material as to produce the greatest output I can muster in a timely manner that doesn't leave me exhausted. Work smarter not harder.</font>
