        <h2>(WEEK 10)</h2>

        <h3>What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?
        </h3>

        <p>Theres no specific aspect I feel like I am struggling with but rather just suffering from a lack of a deeper
            understanding of the tech stack I am using. I understand them well enough to achieve the projects we have
            been given thus far but am aware that there are many rabbit holes espicially with react and django that I
            have not gone down. </p>

        <h3>What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and learn?
        </h3>

        <p> It would be really cool if we had an opportunity to speak with some of the big wigs of the tech industry.
            Google, Meta etc..
        </p>

        <h3>After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point
            for you? Were you able to reconnect your React Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so, what was that
            like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump?
        </h3>

        <p>Yeah I did manage to reconnect my previous React Restaurant project to my backend bistro project and it was a
            lot easier than I expected. It was as simple as exchanging the link in the API call with the new http link
            from my API created in the backend bistro project. Really the only difficultly I faced with connecting the
            two was that I forgot I had to activate the CORS extension on google chrome and also forgot I had to type in
            the commnad "npm start" to view the react project in the browser. Which are two very minor problems.
        </p>
