        <h2>(WEEK 9)</h2>

        <h3>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?
        </h3>

        <p>Both programming languages exhibit a strikingly similar structure, encompassing a common set of data types,
            conditional statements, and loops. However, a notable distinction lies in their syntax, where one language
            employs indentation instead of curly braces for code block delineation.</p>

        <h3>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you
            have benefited?

        </h3>

        <p>While acknowledging the Python language's intuitive syntax, I believe that learning JavaScript, with its
            meticulous nature, fosters a greater emphasis on code accuracy and precision. This emphasis on accuracy
            cultivates a more thorough approach to coding, which can be highly beneficial in developing robust and
            error-free software solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might
            look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see
            yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?
        </h3>

        <p>An app that I use a lot is the "guitartuna" app which provides a guitar tuner and metronome which I use for
            teaching. I could imagine the data structure would consist of <br> Tuning ID: A unique identifier for each
            tuning.
            Name: The name of the tuning, "Standard," "Drop D," "Half Step Down," etc.
            Notes: The specific notes corresponding to each string in the tuning.
            Chord ID: A unique identifier for each chord.
            Name: The name of the chord, like "C Major," "G7," "Dm," etc.
            Notes: The individual notes that make up the chord.
            Audio: Audio representation of the chord for playback.
            <br>
            I'm planning on building a similiar app for my cap stone project.
        </p>
