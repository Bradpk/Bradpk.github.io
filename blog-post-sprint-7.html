        <h3>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?
        </h3>

        <p> </p>

        <h3>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you
            have benefited?

        </h3>

        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might
            look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see
            yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?
        </h3>
